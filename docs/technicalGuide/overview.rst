Overview
--------

This application development guide provides guidelines for developing My Project:

*  	Request My Project to send a payload to another or a compatible messaging gateway on the receiver party;
*  	Retrieve the message identifier of a received message which has not retrieved yet;
*  	Retrieve the payloads of a message which is identified by its message identifier; and
*  	Obtain the message status of an outgoing or incoming message.

For information about installing and communicating with using an external application, please refer to :doc:`installation` and :doc:`web_service_communication`.
